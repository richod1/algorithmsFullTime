- Circular linked -list
- A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list where the last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a closed loop. Circular linked lists can be singly circular (each node points to the next node) or doubly circular (each node has both next and previous pointers). They are useful for applications where you need to repeatedly traverse a list without reaching the end.
- Doubly-Circular-linked list
- A doubly circular linked list is a variation of a doubly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a closed loop. Each node in a doubly circular linked list has both a `next` pointer and a `prev` pointer, allowing for bidirectional traversal, and it forms a circular structure. Doubly circular linked lists are useful for applications where you need to traverse the list in both directions repeatedly.
- Sorted Liked List::=>
- A sorted linked list is a type of linked list where the elements are maintained in sorted order. Whenever a new element is added to the list, it is inserted into its appropriate position to ensure that the list remains sorted. Sorted linked lists are useful when you need to maintain a sorted collection of data efficiently.
