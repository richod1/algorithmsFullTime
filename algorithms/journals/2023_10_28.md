- Circular linked -list
- A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list where the last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a closed loop. Circular linked lists can be singly circular (each node points to the next node) or doubly circular (each node has both next and previous pointers). They are useful for applications where you need to repeatedly traverse a list without reaching the end.
