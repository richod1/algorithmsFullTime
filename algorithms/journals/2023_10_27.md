- TYPES OF LINKED LIST
- Linked lists come in various forms to suit different requirements and use cases. Here are some common types of linked lists:
- 1. **Singly Linked List:** In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the list, forming a unidirectional sequence. It is the most basic form of a linked list.
- 2. **Doubly Linked List:** In a doubly linked list, each node has both a `next` pointer to the next node and a `prev` pointer to the previous node, enabling bidirectional traversal.
- 3. **Circular Linked List:** A circular linked list is a variation of a singly or doubly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a closed loop.
- 4. **Doubly Circular Linked List:** This is a combination of a doubly linked list and a circular linked list. Each node has both `next` and `prev` pointers, and the last node points back to the first node.
- 5. **Sorted Linked List:** A sorted linked list maintains its elements in sorted order. New elements are inserted in their appropriate position in the sorted sequence.
- 6. **Skip List:** A skip list is a type of data structure that uses multiple layers of linked lists to allow for faster searching, similar to a binary search tree. It is particularly useful for maintaining sorted data.
- 7. **Self-adjusting Lists:** These lists prioritize frequently accessed elements by moving them to the front of the list when accessed. Examples include the Move-to-Front List and the Transpose List.
- 8. **Unrolled Linked List:** An unrolled linked list is a variation where multiple elements are stored in a single node to reduce memory overhead. It is often used in certain database structures.
- 9. **XOR Linked List:** In an XOR linked list, each node stores the XOR of the addresses of the previous and next nodes. This technique allows for memory-efficient doubly linked lists but requires bitwise operations for traversal.
- 10. **Hybrid Linked List:** A hybrid linked list combines elements of different types of linked lists, often for specific applications or to optimize certain operations.
- These are some of the common types of linked lists, each tailored to specific use cases and offering advantages in terms of memory efficiency, traversal speed, and data organization. The choice of which type to use depends on the requirements of your specific problem or application.
